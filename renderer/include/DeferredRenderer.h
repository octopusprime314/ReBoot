/**
*  DeferredRenderer class. Generates G buffers including normal and diffuse buffers.
*  DeferredRenderer is a unique renderer and contains 1 shader with a Multi Render Target
*  buffer design.  All two of the previously mentioned textures are generated using a single frame buffer
*  that include a texture attachment which will be deferred and used for a later draw using lights.
*  All lights will be incorporated in this shader for faster lighting calculations because only pixels
*  visible on the screen will be light shaded.
